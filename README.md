# form-validation

I created this using HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

This form will only be validated if the right details are entered.

Criteria for Validation
1. The username requires 3-15 characters
2. The email input requires a proper email before it can be accepted
3. The Password requires 6-25 characters
4. The retype password input will not be validated if the passwords do not match
5. Every error you make in filling this form has its own peculiar error message.

Check the code out to see how well it has been refactored.
